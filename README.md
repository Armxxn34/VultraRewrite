**Vultra Slash Commands**

Well... Its here, Vultra is back and is now in slash commands, I (Armxxn34) got bored and decided to bring back Vultra but keep it open source, It was quite simple because i have other bot that are made in slash commands. 

**Will you consistantly update this code?**

Yes, Every update on vultra will be here too

**What happened to Music And Economy**

Economy has been moved to MrMoney and music has been cancelled because of youtube and many issues with the handler built for music also if i was to do music it would take a few months to actually get this code out!
